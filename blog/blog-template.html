    - How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

    Wireframing with a pair was an effective way to share ideas and plan the layout of a website.

    - Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

    Wireframing provides a helpful visual reference during the development process.

    - What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

    We decided that a good wireframe is clean and simple. It should be easy to read and provide a clear representation of the information hierarchy.

    - What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

    I learned about the <section> semantic element and how it can be used to define a block of related elements.
