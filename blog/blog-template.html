- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Wireframing with a pair was an effective way to share ideas and plan the layout of a website.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Wireframing provides a helpful visual reference during the development process.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that a good wireframe is clean and simple. It should be easy to read and provide a clear representation of the information hierarchy.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned about the <section> semantic element and how it can be used to define a block of related elements.
