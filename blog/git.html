        Version control is a system that allows developers to keep track of the revision history of files, and merge revisions made by different contributors. A repository is a version-controlled folder of files. A commit is a save point in version control. Developers will identify which files have been modified and save the changes as a commit. Commit messages should read like commands (use the imperative.) They should identify which files have been changed and what changes were made.

      <p>
          Git is software that equips file folders with version control. Any folder on your computer can become a Git repository. The first stage of git change is to create a working branch and make your changes there. When the desired changes have been made, prepare them for the commit by using the [git add] command. After staging the changes you want to keep, use [git commit –m “message”] to save them as a commit.

          GitHub hosts repositories online and uses Git to maintain version control. It allows users to access and exchange repositories through the cloud, enabling developers to collaborate on projects. GitHub also provides access to extensive open source material. In addition to facilitating the exchange of information, it allows you to backup your data to the cloud.
