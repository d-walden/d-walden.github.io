        <h4 class="prompt">Designing for Accessibility</h4>
          <p>
            Accessible design is a process that addresses the needs of people with disabilities. Websites that have been designed with accessibility in mind are able to interface with devices that allow users with visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical disabilities to navigate the Internet. Most websites currently have accessibility barriers that make it difficult for people with disabilities to use the Internet. Designing for accessibility enables more people to use and contribute to the World Wide Web.
          </p>

          <p>
            Designing for accessibility also benefits people without disabilities by making websites flexible to meet different user needs. Varying needs could include temporary disabilities, changing abilities due to aging, or slow Internet connection. As the Internet continues to grow and become more deeply engrained in society, so too does the need for accessible design.

          <p>
            One potential way that we can increase accessibility is by developing techniques and guidelines that standardize accessibility requirements. Another way is to develop software that helps developers produce and evaluate accessible websites. The final way that accessibility can be improved is by creating a way to quickly and easily fix inaccessible websites.
