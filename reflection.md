I learned that padding, borders, and margins are important for formatting and distributing the content of a webpage. They create the foundation of your layout.

- What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS positioning is a tricky topic. It sounds simple enough when you’re just reading about it, but it takes first hand experience to really begin to understand how positioning works. When you’re positioning elements, you always have to keep in mind how the neighboring elements will react.

Changing characteristics of font and text was the easiest part of this challenge. Positioning was by far the most difficult for me because of the more abstract concepts at play and the broader range of syntax.
